# Telegram E2E test flows

Seven flows: five for the bot components (`core`) and two for the Telegram User module (`user`). Import with:

```bash
appmixer e2e import src/appmixer/telegram/artifacts/test-flows --account <accountId>
appmixer e2e run <flowId> --fix
```

## Fixtures these flows assume

| Fixture | Value used |
|---|---|
| Bot | `@appmixer_test_bot` (id `8865231953`) |
| Chat | group **v & Appmixer QA**, `chatId` `-5393771328` |

The chat ID is a literal in every flow — change it in one place per flow if you
point these at a different group. The bot must be a **member** of that group, and
for `ListChatAdministrators` the group must have at least one administrator (the
creator always counts).

## Fully automatic flows

| Flow | Covers |
|---|---|
| `test-flow-messaging.json` | SendMessage → EditMessage → ForwardMessage, cleanup via DeleteMessage |
| `test-flow-media.json` | SendPhoto (URL) → GetFile (download) → SendDocument (**upload**), cleanup |
| `test-flow-chat.json` | GetChat, ListChatAdministrators, MakeApiCall |

`test-flow-media.json` deliberately feeds `GetFile`'s stored file back into
`SendDocument`, which is the only coverage of the multipart upload branch in
`lib.sendMedia` — the CLI harness cannot reach it, because
`appmixer test component` uses an ephemeral per-invocation file store, so a file
saved by one invocation is already gone in the next.

## Flows needing one manual action

Telegram never delivers a bot its **own** messages, so neither trigger can be
provoked from inside the flow. Both flows post a prompt into the group and then
wait; `AfterAll` timeout is 600s to leave room for a human.

### `test-flow-newmessage-trigger.json`

1. Start the flow. The bot posts *"E2E: reply to THIS message…"* into the group.
2. **Reply to that message** in Telegram (a plain new message is not enough — the
   group is a regular group and the bot's privacy mode is on, so it only receives
   replies to itself and messages that @-mention it).
3. The trigger fires; the flow asserts `message_id`, `update_kind == "message"`,
   the sender's `from.id` and `chat.type == "group"` (the variable picker offers
   nested fields directly — `From.ID`, `Chat.Type`), then deletes the bot's **own prompt** message. Your reply stays: a bot can
   delete other members' messages only as an administrator with the *Delete
   messages* right, which these flows do not assume.

Note that `from.username` is **optional** in Telegram — a user who never set a
username has none — so the flows do not assert on it. `artifacts/samples/`
holds the recorded shape of a real group reply for `appmixer connector verify
telegram --offline`; record more shapes (a private-chat message, a photo, a
document) with `--record` on a bot that has no webhook registered.

### `test-flow-callbackquery-trigger.json`

1. Start the flow. `MakeApiCall` posts a message carrying an inline keyboard with a
   **Fire E2E** button (`SendMessage` has no `reply_markup` input, so the keyboard
   goes out through the generic call).
2. **Press the button.**
3. `NewCallbackQuery` fires, `AnswerCallbackQuery` acknowledges it (the button stops
   showing its loading spinner), and the prompt message is deleted.

To disable the bot's privacy mode and let the trigger see every group message,
send `/setprivacy` to @BotFather and pick Disable. The flows do not need it.

## Telegram User module (`appmixer.telegram.user`)

Both flows are fully automatic. They need a **Telegram User** account
(`appmixer:telegram:user`: API ID, API Hash and the session string of a user, not
bot, account) next to the bot account. `artifacts/tools/generate-session.js` logs
a user account in and prints the three values:

```bash
cd src/appmixer/telegram && npm install
node artifacts/tools/generate-session.js
```

### `test-flow-user-channel.json`

GetChannel and FindChannelMessages on the public channel **@telegram**, which the
test account has not joined. Read-only.

### `test-flow-user-newchannelpost-trigger.json`

NewChannelPost, provoked from inside the flow: the **bot** publishes a post, the
**user account** reads it.

- Fixture: public channel **@appmixer_e2e_channel** with `@appmixer_test_bot` as an
  administrator that may post and delete messages. To run it elsewhere, create a
  public channel, add your bot as an administrator and replace the username in
  SendMessage, NewChannelPost, the Assert and DeleteMessage.
- `OnStart -> Wait 1m -> SendMessage` publishes the post. The Wait must stay: flow
  start records the newest post as the trigger's baseline, and a post published
  before that is never emitted.
- `NewChannelPost -> Assert -> AfterAll -> DeleteMessage` asserts the post and
  deletes it by the ID the trigger emitted, so the cleanup also proves the trigger
  fired. The poll runs once a minute; AfterAll waits 300 s.

Behaviour that cannot be provoked on a live account (FLOOD_WAIT, a channel going
private, a backlog read over several polls, overlapping polls) is covered by the
unit tests in `artifacts/test/user.test.js`, which run the module against an
in-memory Telegram.
